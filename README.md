# Customer Analysis Project

## Description
This project performs customer analysis by leveraging data from various customer and transaction datasets. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), customer segmentation, and clustering, as well as lookalike modeling to identify similar customers.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
      bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbhiSaranya2004/customer_analysis.git
  
2. Install the required dependencies:
      bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
  

## Usage
To run the analysis:
1. Open the `Abhisaranya_Koyyalamudi_EDA.ipynb` notebook for exploratory data analysis.
2. For lookalike modeling, open the `Abhisaranya_Koyyalamudi_Lookalike.ipynb` notebook.
3. For clustering analysis, use the `Abhisaranya_Koyyalamudi_Clustering.ipynb` notebook.
4. Alternatively, use the `run_all.bat` script to execute all tasks (Windows only).
